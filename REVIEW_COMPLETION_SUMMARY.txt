KEY METRICS & FINDINGS
================================================================================

Overall Quality Scores:
  - Real-Time Executor (agentic-robotics-rt): 2/10 ⚠️ CRITICAL ISSUES
  - Embedded Systems (agentic-robotics-embedded): 0.5/10 ⚠️⚠️ NOT IMPLEMENTED

Focus Area Ratings (out of 10):
  1. Real-Time Deterministic Scheduling: 1/10 (NOT IMPLEMENTED)
  2. Timing Guarantees & Performance: 1/10 (FALSE CLAIMS)
  3. Embedded Compatibility: 0/10 (0% IMPLEMENTED)
  4. Resource Constraints Handling: 2/10 (CONFIG ONLY)
  5. Interrupt Safety: 1/10 (UNSAFE)

Implementation Status:
  - Claimed features: 100%
  - Implemented features: ~15%
  - Documentation gap: 85%

Critical Issues Identified: 5
  1. Tokio is not real-time (fundamental architecture problem)
  2. Scheduler defined but never used (dead code)
  3. No deadline enforcement (misses undetected)
  4. Mutex in critical path (priority inversion)
  5. False documentation claims (severe misrepresentation)

Not Implemented (0%):
  - RTIC integration (commented out)
  - Embassy integration (commented out)
  - no_std support (uses std library)
  - Hard real-time paths (<1ms deadlines)
  - All 4 claimed platforms (STM32, ESP32, nRF, RP2040)

What Works (Partial):
  - HDR histogram latency tracking (good design, silent failures)
  - Priority queue logic (excellent, but unused)
  - Tokio soft real-time (works for 10-100Hz only)
  - Type system design (reasonable foundation)

================================================================================
RECOMMENDATIONS SUMMARY
================================================================================

Immediate Actions (This Week):
  [ ] Update all README files to match actual capabilities
  [ ] Add disclaimer about Tokio limitations
  [ ] Disable non-functional features (embassy, rtic)
  [ ] Fix no_std claim in embedded crate

Short Term (This Month):
  [ ] Refactor executor to use PriorityScheduler
  [ ] Implement deadline tracking and enforcement
  [ ] Add CPU affinity support
  [ ] Create realistic latency benchmarks

Long Term (This Quarter):
  [ ] Architect hard-RT path using RTIC
  [ ] Implement embedded platform support
  [ ] Add safety verification for critical sections
  [ ] Create deployment guides with limitations

Production Readiness: 🔴 CRITICAL - NOT READY
  - ❌ Not safe for hard real-time applications
  - ⚠️ Questionable for time-critical operations
  - ✅ Acceptable for soft real-time (10-100Hz)
  - ❌ Embedded deployment impossible in current form

Estimated Effort: 4-6 weeks (experienced team)

================================================================================
CRITICAL WARNINGS
================================================================================

⚠️ FOR HARD REAL-TIME USE:
   DO NOT USE crates/agentic-robotics-rt for applications with <10ms 
   deadline requirements. Tokio cannot guarantee hard real-time deadlines.

⚠️ FOR EMBEDDED USE:
   DO NOT USE crates/agentic-robotics-embedded in current form. 
   It is 95% unimplemented and will not compile for bare-metal targets.

⚠️ FOR PRODUCTION:
   DO NOT DEPLOY without addressing all critical issues first. 
   The gap between documentation claims and implementation is severe.

================================================================================

   - Participants: Technical leads, architects
   - Materials: REVIEW_FINDINGS_SUMMARY.md + ARCHITECTURAL_RECOMMENDATIONS.md

3. Plan Implementation
   - Use 8-week migration checklist from ARCHITECTURAL_RECOMMENDATIONS.md
   - Break into phases with clear milestones
   - Assign ownership for each phase

4. Track Progress
   - Use provided checklists for each phase
   - Monitor against effort estimates
   - Update documentation as fixes are implemented
